PyBorg ChangeLog
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seisatsu's Mod v5.2 - 27/7/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed another bug in the #nick replacement routine. Nicknames of ops now have their usermode symbols stripped, so they are seen by the routine.

Seisatsu's Mod v5.1 - 27/7/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed some bugs in the #nick replacement routine. The routine now sees nicknames with adjacent punctuation, and it is no longer case sensitive.

Seisatsu's Mod v5 - 25/7/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added notify option to disable annoying private message / CTCP notifications to owners.
* Added !notify command.

Seisatsu's Mod v4 - 24/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* All messages from all users are now labeled and timestamped.
* Added irc logging function.
* Added !logging command to enable or disable logging while running.
* Added logging and logfile settings to configuration

Seisatsu's Mod v3.2 (Bugfix) - 24/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a bug which caused list assignment range errors to occur occasionally.
* Fixed the "#nick" replacement filter to prevent messages from becoming mangled.

Seisatsu's Mod v3.1.1 (v3.1 Bugfix) - 22/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a mistake in version 3.1 that prevented PyBorg from parsing commands.
* Owner commands can now be used in public channels.

Seisatsu's Mod v3.1 (Bugfix) - 22/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a programming oversight in the original source where nicknames were replaced with #nick BEFORE a portion of code in which PyBorg needed to check whether its nickname was in the message body. This prevented said code from working at all.
* PyBorg now doubles its replyrate if its nickname is in the message body. (See above.)
* Fixed changelog (Oops, I never added that inline nolearn feature after all.)

Seisatsu's Mod v3 - 18/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

* Improved the special character filters.

Seisatsu's Mod v2.1 (Bugfix) - 2/6/2009 (Michael D. Reiley / Seisatsu)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed a small bug which caused commands to sometimes be ignored if there were single-letter nicks in the room (the corresponding letter in the command would be replaced with #nick).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added new filters for learn only real words ( no nicknames, no stranges
wors )

* Save now the nicknames as '#nick' word, and replace it by the nickname of
the target when speaking to somebody

* Rewritted the censor routine. Now I am sure that the words won't be
learned and won't be spoken

* Added a file 'words.txt', containing all the words known.

* New unlearn system, with a 'unlearn.txt' file, wich contain all the

sence of the sentece.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v1.0.6 - 29/4/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Added !rebuilddict command. I suggest you run this command when using
1.0.6 for the first time with an old dictionary.

* Added !checkdict command, which fixes broken links in the dictionary.

* Speeded up the !unlearn command. It's a shitload faster now. A fucking
metric shitload to be accurate.

* Speeded up the learn routines. It's now also a greased up silent night
necrophile load faster.

v1.0.5 - 11/3/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Don't need the borg.chans workaround anymore.

* (pyborg-irc) Fixed crash in stealth mode when non-owner types '!'...

v1.0.4 - 24/1/2002
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Catch exceptions and give the user a chance to save that
morbidly large dictionary formed while hanging around on dalnet #sex...

* Changed !learn and !nolearn to a single !learning [on|off] command.

* The !help command now only lists the commands briefly, and !help <command>
gives a more in depth explaination of an individual command.

* Output of !help sent to remote user again, since it is smaller now and
won't get the bot killed for flooding.

* (pyborg-telnet) Fixed to play properly with that strange windows telnet
client (provided it [windows telnet] is in local echo mode).

* (pyborg-irc) Added a configure option and command 'quitmsg', to set
the pyborg quit message. We now properly quit from irc sessions.

* (pyborg-irc) Pyborg listens to CTCP ACTIONs again (broken since moving
to irclib 0.3.x)

v1.0.3 - 10/11/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Stealth mode (!stealth on|off) to disable non owner
commands and lie about our CTCP version.

* Changed to official irclib 0.3.2, which has the fixes mentioned
in changes for 1.0.2.

* Owner command security fix (thanks #q3f people)

v1.0.2 - 18/7/2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Fixed bug which made dictionaries saved in win32 and in unix
incompatible.

* Fixed bug in irclib 0.3.1 where removing channel user limits
crashes the bot.

W in the name crashes the bot.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (pyborg-irc) Changed to use irclib 0.3.1

v1.0.0 - 22/5/2001
