~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a fork of PyBorg Version 1.1.2, with the following modifications:

* A large number of typos were fixed.
* The added ability to automatically rejoin a channel after being kicked. This ability can be enabled in the pyborg-irc configuration file.
* The !rejoin command, which enables or disables the auto rejoin feature.
* Improved/fixed special character filters.
* Added inline ignore feature (start line with ``).
* Owner commands can now be used in public channels.
* PyBorg temporarily doubles its replyrate if its nickname is heard.
* All messages from all users are now labeled and timestamped.
* Ability to log irc chats.
* Ability to disable PM / CTCP notifications.
* Bugfixes.

This archive also includes the original, unpatched files, and the diff files used to patch them. Also added are the required IRC libraries, which are not included in the standard distribution.
